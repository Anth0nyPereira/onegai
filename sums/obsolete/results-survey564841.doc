<tr><td>Do you want to give any remarks?</td><td>The game has an interesting premise and indie vibes, but the execution is far from what I would call a solid playable experience. Visual novels require a lot of polish to justify being a video-game and not just a left-click spamfest. The game needs a lot of work in regards to user experience. Think about what the player is doing, and how to keep him/her engaged through the dense dialogue and themes of the game. Make use of the medium, walls of text and a few face assets are not enough.

That being said, I applaud the effort, and hope the best for your project. Ganbatte!</td></tr>

<tr><td>Did you find any bugs?</td><td>In the later days, in some random cases, the lantern that's around the character's image didn't move to the character's name, it stopped halfway.
During the scene where the Old man is remembering his home and furniture, some furniture doesn't appear after clicking and the screen sometimes turns completely white however I was still able to interact with the game.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Do you want to give any remarks?</td><td>To start, the visual aesthetics were very unique and unusual (the good kind).
I also enjoyed the biblical aspects and the surrealism of it all.
The character's faces were a bit in the "uncanny valley", but I think it was kind of the point.
Most of the negatives I've seen were towards the UI elements and the game itself:
-There was no menu or pause function;
-The dialogue UI (lantern, character, text box) was a bit transparent, so it made them blend in a bit with the background;
-The lantern takes up a lot of screen space making the screen cluttered;
-(nitpick) In the text box, "b" and "h" with the font were similar but besides that, I managed to read without worries;

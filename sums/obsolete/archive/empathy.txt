Dispositional empathy, on the other hand, encompasses both cognitive and affective components, including the tendency to experience feelings of warmth, sympathy, and concern towards others.

Also known as trait empathy, dispositional empathy is the tendency for people to imagine and experience the feelings and experiences of others. Researchers typically discuss dispositional empathy in contrast to state or situational empathy, which is an immediate response to a specific eliciting situation.

Thus the ability to share anotherâ€™s internal states and explicitly considering those states is known as dispositional empathy (DE) which is typically divided into cognitive and affective components.

Cognitive empathy (CE) is the capacity to understand perspective or mental state of others. It is taken as synonymous term for theory of mind.
